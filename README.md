# basereduce

`basereduce` is a Python library designed to streamline the process of extracting knowledge from large foundational computer vision models and distilling it into smaller, more efficient models. This library facilitates the creation of lightweight models that retain the prowess of their larger counterparts, making it ideal for edge computing and applications with limited computational resources.

## Features

- **Prompt Generation**: Automate the creation of image prompts using powerful language models.
- **Image Generation**: Generate synthetic datasets with state-of-the-art generative models.
- **Dataset Annotation**: Leverage foundation models to automatically label datasets.
- **Edge Model Training**: Train efficient small-scale neural networks for edge deployment.
